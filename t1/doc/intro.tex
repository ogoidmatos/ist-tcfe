% state the learning objective 
\tab The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing both dependent ($I_b$, $V_c$) and independent ($I_d$, $V_a$) current and voltage sources, connected to resistors ($R_1$ to $R_7$).
The circuit and its organization can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
