\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\tab The objective of this laboratory assignment as been accomplished as can be seen by the results obtained. The Ngspice simulator is a very powerful tool, however, we encountered some problem while simulating the circuit, particularly with the current-controlled voltage source, as it was explained in subsection~\ref{subsec:op_analysis}.\par
During this laboratory, we encountered some difficulties regarding where to put our node 0 in the circuit. We were unsure of the best location to put it, and we noticed that by changing its position in the circuit, the results obtained in ngspice and in octave (by resulting in a different node matrix) were different. In order to facilitate the calculations, we decided on the position that can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.\par
As can be seen by comparing the tables, both octave maths tool and circuit simulator Ngspice data match, although not perfectly, since both tools use different methods of calculations and the Ngspice tool is in fact simulation tool, contrary to Octave that was only used for theoretical calculations. If this was done in a laboratory with real equipment we would expect the results to be similar to the ones we obtained, having the results a slight discrepancy (which might have its source in the fact that the different programs are using a different number of decimal parcels in their calculations).
