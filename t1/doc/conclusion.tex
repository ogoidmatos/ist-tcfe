\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\tab The objective of this laboratory assignment as been accomplished as can be seen by the results obtained. The Ngspice simulator is a very powerful tool, however, we encountered some problem while simulating the circuit, particularly with the current-controlled voltage source, as it was explained in subsection~\ref{subsec:op_analysis}.\par
As can be seen by comparing the tables, both octave maths tool and circuit simulator Ngspice data match, although not perfectly, since both tools use different methods of calculations and the Ngspice tool is in fact simulation tool, contrary to Octave that was only used for theoretical calculations. If this was done in a laboratory with real equipment we would expect the results to be similar to the ones we obtained, having the results a slight discrepancy (which might have its source in the fact that the different programs are using a different number of decimal parcels in their calculations).
