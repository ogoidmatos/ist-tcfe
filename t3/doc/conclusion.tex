\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\tab The objective of this laboratory assignment has been accomplished as can be seen by the results obtained. As desired, the average output voltage of circuit is 12V and the ripple is minimal, as can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:merit_spice}. Using these values to calculate the merit of the circuit, for a \textbf{cost of 432.28}, we obtained a \textbf{merit of 1.042951 }in Ngspice.

Once again, we can note the small difference from the results obtained in Octave due to the non-linearity nature of the diode components.
