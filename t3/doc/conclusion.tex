\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\tab The objective of this laboratory assignment as been accomplished as can be seen by the results obtained. The Ngspice simulator is a very powerful tool, as we can see by aproximating very acurately the theorical model.\par
As can be seen by comparing the tables and figures, both Octave maths tool and circuit simulator Ngspice data match, almost perfectly, the differences are explained by the rounding of the last decimal case. Once again, the model used can be seen to accurately describe the results we obtain, as it was to be expected.
