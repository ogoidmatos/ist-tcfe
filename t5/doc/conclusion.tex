\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\tab The objective of this laboratory assignment has been accomplished as can be seen by the results obtained. As desired, the gain is high (aprox. 35.7 dB) and although the cost is big the performance is excellent.

Despite our efforts to get equal results with the different analysis, we concluded that, due to the non-linearity of the components of the circuit, particularly the transistors, it was impossible to obtain the exact same results. The model used by Ngspice is far more complex than the one used in the theoretical analysis.

Comparing the output impedances and the input impedances we can see that even though they are not exactly the same, they are similar. Comparing the graphics we observe similar curves with similar CO frequencies.

In conclusion, as can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:merit_spice} for a \textbf{cost of 8122.45}, we obtained a \textbf{merit of 1278.9 }in Ngspice, which we found to be excellent results.
